@article{Doersch2016,
abstract = {In just three years, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.},

abstract = {We define and address the problem of unsupervised learning of disentangled representations on data generated from independent factors of variation. We propose FactorVAE, a method that disentangles by encouraging the distribution of representations to be factorial and hence independent across the dimensions. We show that it improves upon {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-VAE by providing a better trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we highlight the problems of a commonly used disentanglement metric and introduce a new metric that does not suffer from them.},

Taking a rate-distortion theory perspective, we show the circumstances under which representations aligned with the underlying generative factors of variation of data emerge when optimising the modified ELBO bound in {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-VAE, as training progresses. From these insights, we propose a modification to the training regime of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-VAE, that progressively increases the information capacity of the latent code during training. This modification facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-VAE, without the previous trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.},

@article{Goodfellow2012,
abstract = {We consider the problem of object recogni- tion with a large number of classes. In or- der to overcome the low amount of labeled examples available in this setting, we in- troduce a new feature learning and extrac- tion procedure based on a factor model we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C). Prior work on S3C has not prioritized the abil- ity to exploit parallel architectures and scale S3C to the enormous problem sizes needed for object recognition. We present a novel inference procedure for appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors that S3C may be trained with. We demonstrate that this ap- proach improves upon the supervised learn- ing capabilities of both sparse coding and the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Ma- chine (ssRBM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use the CIFAR-100 dataset to demonstrate that our method scales to large numbers of classes better than previous methods. Fi- nally, we use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Chal- lenge.},

abstract = {We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning. Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.},
